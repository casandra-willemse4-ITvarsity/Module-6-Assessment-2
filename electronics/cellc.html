            <p>Cell C has almost tripled its customer base since 2012, <br>acting as a disruptor and pushing for regulatory changes<br>
            such as lower and asymmetrical mobile termination rates.<br> A study commissioned by the South African <br>National
            Treasury and conducted by the <br>University of Johannesburg's Centre for Competition,<br> Regulation and Economic
            Development found that<br> the lower termination rates introduced <br>in 2011 has saved South African <br>consumers R47 billion over
            five years</p>
