            <h1>The Body Shop</h1>
       
            <p>Our story started in 1976. It began with <br>our founder, Anita Roddick,<br> opening a little green shop<br> in Brighton with a
                <br>belief in something revolutionary:<br> that business could be a force<br> for good. We’ve never been your<br> average
            cosmetics company, with over 40 years of campaigning,<br> change-making and<br> smashing beauty industry<br> standards – and
            we’re still going strong. Welcome to The Body Shop.</p>
