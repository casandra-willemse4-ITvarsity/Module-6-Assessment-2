    <h1>Fragrance Boutique</h1>

    <p>Our humble beginnings began with the <br>dream of creating a luxury boutique-style<br> environment where fragrance<br>
        lovers could discover the<br> joy of reverse engineered fragrances, <br>generic fragrances packaged in no nonsense<br>
        bottles, <br>without the international marketing & advertising costs. <br>We believe that “you wear the
        fragrance, not the packaging” & our<br> first slogan was “the price brings you in & the<br> quality brings you
        back”, <br>this still stands today. </p>
