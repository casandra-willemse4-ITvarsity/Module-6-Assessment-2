    <h1>Boxer</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Boxer is one of the fastest growing discount supermarkets <br>in Southern Africa. With a cemented set of ‘people
        centered’ goals and values, we have <br>positioned ourselves as ‘Africa’s Favourite <br>Discount Supermarket’ - a
        discounter that caters for<br> the needs of the enlarged middle to lower income<br> consumer market. Since our
        beginnings, more than four <br>decades ago in 1977, in KwaZulu-Natal’s<br> Empangeni community, the Boxer brand has<br>
        grown far and wide and includes well <br>defined retail offerings that boast<br> stores spread in every province of<br>
        South Africa, as well as in <br>the Kingdom of eSwatini (Swaziland).</p>
